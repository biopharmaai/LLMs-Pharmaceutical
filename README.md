## Oncology trial data fusion AI

 
ChemicalQDevice innovates novel oncology clinical trial simulations based on trial data fusion AI. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and xAI large language models are utilized to generate supporting reports, meta-analyses, and proposals. Comparative analysis and meta-verifications across multiple models address model bias. External validations based on prior studies help to establish generalizability.
